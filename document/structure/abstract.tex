Taking the right decision when buying infrastructure to deploy your huge and complex software system can often be difficult nowadays. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) has been production ready for some years now and gains high popularity among productive and successful businesses. Instead of hiring dedicated hardware at your hosting provider of choice with your fixed capacity at the preferred destination, IaaS tries to tackle and solve common problems of the traditional approach. IaaS offers virtualized infrastructure without any upfront capacity decisions to provide a highly available, scaleable and flexible system for your software. This paper introduces IaaS as moving infrastructure to the cloud and illustrates it's opportunities and benefits. The paper outlines the technical details and explains how IaaS works under the hood, how it can be managed, integrated and monitored. We look at big internet companies behind the technology and their own infrastructure model. It will be discussed why customers can save money by buying infrastructure in the cloud and paying only for the capacity the really use and at the same time increase their revenue due to the simple management of instances.
